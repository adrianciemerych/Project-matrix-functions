# Project-matrix-functions

This is a project comprises a few functions for easier work with matrices.
The functions often are made for particular matrices so they couldn't work on all possible shapes of matrices

Here is short description for each function:
1. determinant_of_matrix - function created for computing determinant of matrix for shapes 2x2 and 3x3
2. laplace_determinant - it is a function also for calculating determinant of matrix but improved also for matrix 4x4.
                         At some point it also uses determinant_of_matrix.
3. sarrus_determinant - it's function for calculating determinant of matrix using rule of sarrus and only for matrices 3x3
4. transpose_matrix - this function transposes the matrix. Working on all matrices
5. inverse_matrix - this function returns inverse matrix. It can calculate inverse matrix for matrices 2x2 and 3x3.
6. rank_of_matrix - function created for computing rank of matrix 4x4 or 3x3
